###Purpose
This is a pong game where you will be able to win from a prize pool of Seimoyed. However you will also be able to lose and grow the prize pool as a result. The goal is to set
up the difficulty of the game based on the size of the prize pool or perhaps just change the reward structure based on how large the prize pool is.
